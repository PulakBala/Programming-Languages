        <Accordion.Header> What is cors?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
          When a web page or web application makes a request to a different
          domain, the web browser sends a preflight request to the server to
          determine whether the request is allowed. The preflight request is an
          HTTP OPTIONS request that includes some additional headers to indicate
          the type of request that will be made. The server then checks the
          request headers and returns a response that indicates whether the
          request is allowed or not. If the request is allowed, the server
          includes some additional headers that allow the web browser to access
          the requested resource. CORS is an important security feature because
          it prevents malicious websites from making requests to other websites
          on behalf of the user. It also prevents sensitive data from being
          accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, it can sometimes
          cause issues when developing web applications, especially when making
          requests to APIs or services hosted on a different domain. In these
          cases, the server must be configured to allow requests from the
          specific domain that the web application is hosted on.

          Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
          implement authentication?

        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
          Firebase is a popular backend as a service (BaaS) platform that
          provides a variety of features and services, including authentication.
          It offers a simple and easy-to-use authentication system that supports
          several authentication methods, such as email and password, Google,
          Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more. Firebase also provides a user
          management system that allows developers to manage users and their
          data easily. <br /> <br /> Some reasons why developers might choose
          Firebase for authentication include: <br /> Quick and easy
          integration: Firebase provides a simple SDK and API that makes it easy
          to integrate authentication into your web or mobile application.{" "}
          <br /> Security: Firebase handles security concerns such as password
          storage, encryption, and brute-force attack prevention, which can be
          challenging for developers to implement correctly on their own.
          <br /> Scalability: Firebase's authentication system can handle a
          large number of users and is scalable as your application grows.

        <Accordion.Header> How does the private route work?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          The react private route component renders child components ( children
          ) if the user is logged in. If not logged in the user is redirected to
          the /login page with the return url passed in the location state
          property.

        <Accordion.Header>What is Node? How does Node work?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          At its core, Node is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the
          same engine used by Google Chrome to execute JavaScript in the
          browser. However, unlike JavaScript in the browser, which is limited
          to interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) and making network
          requests, Node allows JavaScript to interact with the file system,
          operating system, and other low-level functionality that is typically
          the domain of server-side languages like Java or Python. Node works by
          providing a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that is
          optimized for building scalable, networked applications. When a Node
          application starts, it creates an event loop that continuously listens
          for incoming requests. When a request comes in, Node creates a new
          event and adds it to the event queue. The event loop then checks the
          event queue to see if there are any events waiting to be processed. If
          there are, it takes the first event off the queue and passes it to the
          appropriate event handler, which is typically a callback function. One
          of the key advantages of Node is its ability to handle a large number
          of concurrent connections without blocking. Because Node is
          single-threaded, it doesn't have to worry about context switching,
          which can be a significant source of overhead in multi-threaded
          applications. Instead, it uses a non-blocking I/O model that allows it
          to process multiple requests concurrently, without having to wait for
          one request to finish before moving on to the next. In summary, Node
          is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that
          allows developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.
          It provides a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that is
          optimized for building scalable, networked applications, and uses a
          non-blocking I/O model to handle a large number of concurrent
          connections without blocking.
